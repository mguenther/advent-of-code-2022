# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code season 2022. My programming language of choice was again Python this year. I didn't bother using PyPy, but went with vanilla CPython. All solutions compute in a reasonable amount of time.

The solution for day 21 requires [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html).
